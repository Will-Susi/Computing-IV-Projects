## Description
Explain what the project is supposed to do: This project is supposed to give the writer a basic intro to SFML programming and documentation.

### Features
Describe what your major decisions were and why you did things that way:

The major decisions I had to make were around the sprite and its movement, and the additional feature of my choice. 
I chose a lightsaber sprite in pair with a basic key stroke controlling method of using the arrow keys where each arrow key was linked to an if statement that would move the sprite in accordance to the arrow direction. 
For the additional feature I chose to add audio that replicated the lightsaber swinging to practice the use of it before we would have to use it in future projects.

### Issues
What doesn't work. Be honest. You might be penalized if you claim something works and it doesn't.

I have two workstations, my laptop (windows 11) and my desktop (windows 10).
I did the needed setup for sfml on w10, including the audio, but must have done something wrong because when trying to use the audio feature I keep getting a list of errors after I run the program.
It works fine on w11 so that's why I assume I messed something in the setup up for the w10. 

### Extra Credit
Anything special you did. This is required to earn bonus points.

Just attempting to use the audio library before our future instructed use, but I don't know if I'd consider that 'special'.

## Changes
Details of what changes you made to your project.

I got points off for two things. One was I accidentally left a feature in that was meant to be removed so that has now been removed. 
I also forgot to add displaying the original green circle on top of the extended demo code so that has now been implemented.

## Integrity
Read the University policy Academic Integrity, and answer the following question:
There are six examples of academic misconduct, labeled (a) through (f). Other than (a), "Seeks to claim credit for the work or efforts of another without authorization or citation," which of these do you think would most apply to this class, and why? Write approx. 100-200 words. Note: there is no single correct answer to this. I am looking for your opinion.

The example that seems most applicative to this course, in my opinion, is (c): "Forges or falsifies academic documents or records". I say this because from what I have gathered so far from the course description, there seems to be a bigger emphasis on self-documentation. As the class outline has stated, a big part of this class is going to be documenting work, so itâ€™s important that recordings of your work are indeed true. Not only is this important for academic integrity, but for future practice. Proper documentation can show you both your weaknesses and strengths and thus give you an accurate depiction on where improvements can be made. Like copying work, making response/documentation up doesn't help you or anyone else, and is not good practice for your future career.
