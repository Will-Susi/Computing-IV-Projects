# Computing-IV-Projects
This is the cumulative code and documentation for the projects
I completed during my C++ based computing class at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.

The first file is a LaTeX document that gives an overview of the class.

Each project has an additional ReadMe that documents the functionality and creation of the code.
